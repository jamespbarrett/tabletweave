<h1>Tablet Weaving Draft Designer Instructions</h1>

<div id="explanation">

  <p>TDD is designed to produce tablet weaving patterns with two sections; the threading diagram and the turning diagram. The threading diagram (at the bottom) shows how the tablets should be set up and the turning diagram (at the top) shows how forwards and backwards turns of the tablets will make the pattern. Each column of the turning diagram represents one tablet and each row represents a single pick (or row) of weaving. Each oval in both the threading and turning diagrams represent a single warp thread.</p>
 
  <ol>
    <li>Use the controls to select the number of tablets you want, how many
holes they should have, and how many picks you want the turning
diagram to have.</li>
    <li>Select the threading of each tablet by clicking on the S or Z below
the threading diagram. The letters correspond to the way that the
threads pass through the tablet, as described by Peter Collingwood in
"The Techniques of Tablet Weaving". The oval shapes in the threading
diagram correspond to the alignment of the tablets on the warp when
viewed from above.</li>
    <li>Click on a colour from the palette to select it, adjusting it using
the RGB sliders if needed, and click on an oval in the threading
diagram to change its colour. The number you see under each colour in
the palette shows how many threads of each colour have been used in
the threading diagram.</li>
    <li>TDD will automatically update the turning diagram if you change the
threading direction or the thread colours in the threading diagram.</li>
    <li>The squares in the turning diagram with white backgrounds show that
the tablet should be turned forwards; click on the square to change
the background to grey to show that the tablet should turn
backwards. Every pick above the point where you changed the turning
direction will also change turning direction automatically. During
weaving, the warp threads will twine (twist) in the direction shown by
the ovals of the turning diagram.</li>
    <li>You can save your work as a json file or turn the pattern into a jpeg
or png image file.</li>
  </ol>
